This allows you easily to integrate filters on your site independently from a theme or page builder you use.

### Page builders
The plugin is compatible with almost all page builders. It was tested with Elementor, Divi, Themify, WPBakery Composer, Oxygen, Beaver builder, Bricks Builder, Breakdance etc.
